This is very much a work-in-progress, combining my love of craft beer with my love of programming! I'm putting this into a GitHub repository so that I can learn about work flow and version control, whilst working on my project. The current code works but produces a limited number of basic bar charts (see PNG images in repository) which have very little visual appeal. They do, however, provide statistics which are not available directly via the app (even if you pay the subscription) and would take a lot of time to obtain using a basic spreadsheet. I am focussing on statistics such as mean beer rating by beer style, country, brewery, and so on. My code only includes entries with the highest frequencies, to ensure that a beer with one high rating cannot elevate a brewery to the top of the graph, for example.
