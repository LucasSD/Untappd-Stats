Quick Demo

My aim is to continue to improve and add to this project, which combines my love of craft beer with my love of programming! I'm putting this into a GitHub repository so that I can learn about work flow and version control. The current code works and produces a number of horizontal bar charts (see PNG images in repository). They provide statistics which are not available directly via the app (even if you pay the subscription) and would take a lot of time to obtain using a basic spreadsheet. I am focussing on statistics such as mean beer rating by beer style, country, brewery, and so on. My code only includes entries with the highest frequencies, to ensure that a beer with one high rating cannot elevate a brewery to the top of the graph, for example.
