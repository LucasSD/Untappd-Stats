This is very much a work-in-progress, combining my love of craft beer with my love of programming! I'm putting this into a GitHub repository so that I can learn about

They do, however, provide statistics which are not available directly via the app (even if you pay the subscription) and would take a lot of time to obtain using a basic 
spreadsheet. I am focussing on statistics such as mean beer rating by beer style, country, brewery, and so on.
